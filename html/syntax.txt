HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. A document type declaration lets browsers know we are using HTML.

<!DOCTYPE html>

To create HTML structure and content, we need HTML tags. Anything between them is interpreted as HTML code.

<html></html>

The <head> element contains all the metadata for a web page. Metadata isn't displayed on the page.

<head></head>

The <head> element can contain the page title.

<title></title>

HTML is composed of elements. An elemnet has: <Opening Tag>Content</Closing Tag>

Elements
<h*></h*> - Headers. Replace * with 1 - 6
<body></body - Body. Only content within the <body> can be displayed on the screen. Indentation is not needed in HTML but makes code easier to read
<div></div - Division. Container that breaks the page into sections. Style can be applied to all elements within a <div> element
<p></p> - Paragraph. Contain a block of plain text
<span></span> - Span. Contain small pieces of text or HTML. Used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content
<br> - Line Break. No closing tag, moves following text to new line
<ul></ul> - Unordered List. Bullet point list with no ordinals. Items in the list must be added using the <li> tag
<ol></ol> - Ordered List. Bullet point list with ordinals. Items in the list must be added using the <li> tag
<li></li> - Line Item. Adds a new item to a list on a new line.
<img /> - Image. Self-closing tag for adding an image to a page. Must contain the src attribute.
<video></video> - Video. Tag for adding a video to a page. Must contain the src attribute.
<a></a> - Anchor. Adds a link to a page. Must contain the the href attribute


Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used to for everything from providing info to changing style. Attributes have two parts:
  - name of the attribute
  - value of the attribute

id="***" - Gives the element an ID
src="***" - Source for a video or image
width="***" - Width of an element
height="***" - Height of an element
controls = - Adds basic controls such as play and pause
href ="**" - Hypertext reference, links to a path
target = 

Style tags allow style to be applied to text

<em></em> - Emphasises text. Generally renders as italics.
<strong></storng> - Highlights important text. Generally renders as bold.
